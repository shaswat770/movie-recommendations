## 📽️ Movie Recommender System

This is a simple Movie Recommender System implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It recommends movies to users based on their preferences using content-based filtering techniques.

### 🚀 Features

* Content-based recommendation
* Data preprocessing using Pandas
* Cosine similarity for finding similar movies
* Interactive user input for movie recommendations

### 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Numpy
* Jupyter Notebook

### 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender.git
   cd movie-recommender
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

### 🧠 How It Works

* Reads and processes the movie dataset
* Extracts features from genres, keywords, or descriptions
* Computes similarity using cosine similarity
* Recommends movies based on user selection

### 🎯 Example

If the user likes **"The Dark Knight"**, the system might recommend:

* Batman Begins
* Inception
* The Prestige

### 📊 Future Improvements
